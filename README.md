# react-parallel-universes

you wrote some code. you're not super happy about it.

how do you refactor it and how will those choices pan out as you write more code?

take a glimpse into alternate futures; the evolution of three different patterns within a codebase:
Container / View, Render Props, Higher Order Components

also [recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose) is dope



### to improve

- do "render table" before adding filtering (showing how you can swap out view)
- then add filtering (composability)


- using precise language to be less confusing
